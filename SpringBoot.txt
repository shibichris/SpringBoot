Spring Boot

Spring Boot is a project that is built on the top of the Spring Framework. 
It provides an easier and faster way to set up, configure, and run both 
simple and web-based applications.


It is a Spring module that provides the RAD (Rapid Application Development)
feature to the Spring Framework. It is used to create a stand-alone 
Spring-based application that you can just run because it needs minimal 
Spring configuration.

What is Spring Boot

In short, Spring Boot is the combination of Spring Framework and Embedded Servers.

In Spring Boot, there is no requirement for XML configuration (deployment descriptor). 
It uses convention over configuration software design paradigm that means 
it decreases the effort of the developer.

We can use Spring STS IDE or Spring Initializr to develop Spring Boot Java applications.
