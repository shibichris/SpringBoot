Advantages of Spring MVC Framework

Let's see some of the advantages of Spring MVC Framework:-

Separate roles - The Spring MVC separates each role, where the model object, 
controller, command object, view resolver, DispatcherServlet, validator, etc. 
can be fulfilled by a specialized object.

Light-weight - It uses light-weight servlet container to develop and deploy your application.

Powerful Configuration - It provides a robust configuration for both framework and 
application classes that includes easy referencing across contexts, such as from web 
controllers to business objects and validators.

Rapid development - The Spring MVC facilitates fast and parallel development.

Reusable business code - Instead of creating new objects, it allows us to use the 
existing business objects.

Easy to test - In Spring, generally we create JavaBeans classes that enable you 
to inject test data using the setter methods.

Flexible Mapping - It provides the specific annotations that easily redirect the page.
