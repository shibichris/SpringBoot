Advantages of Spring Boot

It creates stand-alone Spring applications that can be 
started using Java -jar.

It tests web applications easily with the help of different 
Embedded HTTP servers such as Tomcat, Jetty, etc. We don't 
need to deploy WAR files.

It provides opinionated 'starter' POMs to simplify our
 Maven configuration.

It provides production-ready features such as metrics, 
health checks, and externalized configuration.

There is no requirement for XML configuration.

It offers a CLI tool for developing and testing the 
Spring Boot application.

It offers the number of plug-ins.

It also minimizes writing multiple boilerplate codes 
(the code that has to be included in many places with 
little or no alteration), XML configuration, and annotations.

It increases productivity and reduces development time.
